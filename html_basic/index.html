    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>This is my very first web page, created as part of my learning journey in web development.</p>
    <p>I am building this portfolio to showcase my projects and skills as I continue to grow.</p>
    
    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>This project helps me understand the basics of HTML, file structure, and pushing changes to GitHub.</p>
    
    <h3>Future Goals</h3>
    <p>In the future, I plan to add styling with CSS and interactivity with JavaScript.</p>
